## ðŸ“ˆ The ROI Factor: Value for Money

Choosing an MBA is an investment, and evaluating the **Return on Investment (ROI)** is key. In the Northeast, government colleges offer some of the highest ROI nationally due to their highly subsidized fee structures.

The brand value ensures superior long-term career growth and faster returns despite the initial investment. | Recommended for those targeting top consulting, finance, or tech roles nationally. |


## ðŸ“Œ General Admission Criteria Summary

Here is a typical breakdown of the selection process you can expect at most reputable MBA institutions in Assam:

1.  **Entrance Exam Score:** This remains the most crucial factor, often carrying a **50% to 70%** weightage in the initial shortlisting and final merit list.
2.  **Personal Interview (PI):** A mandatory step across all top colleges, testing your communication, subject knowledge, and career motivation (often **15% to 25%** weightage).
3.  **Group Discussion (GD):** Common at many state and private colleges, evaluating teamwork and thought process (typically **10% to 15%** weightage).
4.  **Academic Profile:** Your undergraduate and high school scores are considered, with premier institutes like IIT Guwahati assigning specific marks to them.
5.  **Work Experience:** While not mandatory, relevant work experience is a significant advantage, especially at IIT Guwahati, which gives it a specific weightage.

A solid **CAT** score is your best ticket for admission and scholarships across the board. If CAT is too challenging, a high **MAT** or **CMAT** score will open doors to almost every other institution in the region.
