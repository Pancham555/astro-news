# **Trying Meta AI for the First Time**

So Today, I got my hands on Meta AI, and decided to give it a try and my initial impressions is kinda mid.

**cuz**, it might be one of those rare instances where I am able to get my hands on a decently powerful enough ai *text-to-video* models which I could try, and this was one of it…

I can say that it is powerful enough to create AI-SLOP (if you wanna say it in the way I like it so…) but what’s more important is how this would eventually progress bcuz, as days are passing, the general public are able to get their hands really powerful models (like this one) for free at no cost, which was not possible, 2 years back.

I remember when Midjourney came into existence, and almost every creator was using it to shove some of it’s AI-SLOP into their videos, and if I compare that with what today’s free tier models are capable to deliver, then I can say, we are getting advanced real fast.

Remember the *“Will Smith Eating Spagetti”* video back from 2023, it has now got so advanced that it is now virtually impossible for a mid-aged person to identify between a real video and an AI-SLOP…

## **Possible Implications**

There is a high chance that these AI-SLOPS might be used to create fake bodycam and video footages and could be weaponized against certain individuals to put them behind bars for I don’t know, indefinitely, and unfortunately, in the near future, even courts and forensic experts won’t be able to distinguish between what’s real and what’s fake.

We have gone to the point that videos evidences are no longer believable, unfortunately.

And UNFORTUNATELY, this is only going to continue to be worse, as corporate greed and capitalism rises, this would pose a serious challenge to courts.

Watch this video of Mutahar \[Not promotion or sponsored] showing how this stuff would become a threat to the society in general

```

And yes, I got the idea of writing this blog from that video only.

## **So What’s My Take**

The Meta AI model is doing pretty great, but as of now it’s not able to create audios of the video it produces, but I am sure it would in the near future Here are 2 of the AI-SLOPS I produced, through it, you wanna watch, go check it out.
